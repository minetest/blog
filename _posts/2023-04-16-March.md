## Engine News

The developers spent March working on a release, see the
[5.7.0 release post](https://blog.minetest.net/2023/04/08/5.7.0-released/)
for all the information.

## Games News

[Repixture](https://content.luanti.org/packages/Wuzzy/repixture/) release
3.9.0, “The Update That Changed Sounds Forever”, is a huge rework of sounds. The
old soundscape was somewhat jarring, but now, after a lot of work and a few
hundred new sound files, walking, digging and placing sounds much better.

Additionally, [Wuzzy](https://content.luanti.org/users/Wuzzy/) introduced a
[player manual](https://wuzzy.codeberg.page/Repixture/), which is not a
walkthrough but should help you get started with the game. It serves as a
reference for the game's mechanics.

## Mods News

### AP Airship

{% include figure_gallery.html items=page.airship %}

Primarily an experiment with attachments,
[AP Airship](https://github.com/minetest/blog/issues/81) by
[Apercy](https://content.luanti.org/users/apercy/) adds a huge dirigible
balloon. Like Steampunk Blimp players can walk around inside it, and it adds
special features such as clickable seats, more control, and a better ladder.
Fuel is disabled for now, so it can fly indefinitely, but in the future Apercy
will add a fuel mechanic. The Airship is affected by winds and supports
climate_api from TestificateMods.

### Pizzaria

{% include figure.html src="/static/blog/2023_March/pizza.png"
    caption="Pizza al forno" %}

[Pizzaria](https://content.luanti.org/packages/Extex/jelys_pizzaria/) by
[Extex](https://content.luanti.org/users/Extex/) immerses you in your
pizza-building quest. You will form the dough with a rolling pin, place
ingredients on your pizza, physically place your pizza in the oven, and then
slice up your masterpiece with a flourish using a pizza cutter.

Minetest Game lacks meat, cheese, tomatoes, and olives. Pizzaria supports
toppings from other mods such as pineapple and mobs_redo, but as a fallback,
Extex invented "The Mese Mutation Crystal", which allows players to turn their
wealth into pizza ingredients. Running a pizza shop will require a steady stream
of mese, gold, apples and ... bones. This could get interesting.



### Mesecons

[Wuzzy](https://content.luanti.org/users/Wuzzy/) contributed an update for
[Mesecons](https://content.luanti.org/packages/Jeija/mesecons/) which adds
pitch variation for noteblocks, increasing the range of possible sounds. A
player can set the pitch for a sound from C to B by punching the block just as
with the piano sounds. Fire and explosions have been excluded from pitch
modification to preserve their quality.

### Mobs Redo

{% include figure.html src="/static/blog/2023_March/mobs_damage.png"
    caption="Ow!" %}

[Mobs Redo](https://content.luanti.org/packages/TenPlus1/mobs/) by
[tenplus1](https://content.luanti.org/users/TenPlus1/) added a damage
flash indicator. Whenever a mob is hit it will glow orange for a moment if the
setting `mob_hit_effect` is set to true. Mod authors can also define a custom
`damage_texture_modifier` in the mob definition. Additionally, the API now has
support for an injured animation, although mods will have to be updated to make
use of it.

### Everness

{% include figure_gallery.html items=page.everness %}

[Everness's](https://content.luanti.org/packages/SaKeL/everness/) "Deep Ocean"
update brings 3 new ocean biomes with sands, craftable blocks, corals, and ocean
plants. It adds a "shell of underwater breathing" which makes exploring these
biomes easier. Smaller fixes include new sounds for dirt, grass and ice blocks
and Igloos with loot chests in Frosted Icesheet biomes. Happy exploring,
everyone!

### X Farming

{% include youtube.html id="3Sz1EZxPMms" %}

[X Farming](https://content.luanti.org/packages/SaKeL/x_farming/)
by [Sakel](https://content.luanti.org/users/SaKeL/) added a new scarecrow
decoration for your farms. It can be activated with X farming's bonemeal,
making any nearby plants grow faster.

### Modlib

{% include figure.html src="/static/blog/2023_March/modlibb3d.png"
    caption="A train model converted into glTF and editable in Blender" %}

[Modlib's](https://content.luanti.org/packages/LMD/modlib/) B3D to glTF
converter has been fixed and tested on about 1000 models from ContentDB. With
this update, mod authors can use modlib to convert otherwise un-editable b3d
models into an editable glTF format, allowing the community to clean up old
models and re-export them. All animations are preserved during the process. In
other words, even if the original Blender files have been lost, the model may be
edited. In the future, it may also help with providing an easy upgrade path from
B3D to glTF when Minetest gets support for glTF.

An example workflow is [here](https://github.com/appgurueu/modlib/blob/master/doc/b3d.md).
