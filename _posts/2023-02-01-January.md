    caption="The Clock Room in Piranesi" %}

Warr1024 has continued development on iarbat's game jam submission "Piranesi". The original 
had several bugs that made it impossible to complete; this version fixes those. It
aims to recreate the puzzles in Piranesi as originally intended, but with bugfixes, refinements, quality-of-life improvements, improved accessibility, and translations. More highlights of improvements in the CDB description.
iarbat does not intend to continue the original Piranesi now, and endorses Piranesi Restoration Project as its successor.
