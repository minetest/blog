## Engine News

We released Minetest 5.7.0 in April, read
[the release blog post](/2023/04/08/5.7.0-released/) for all the details.

The ability to override item images has been merged now. This will make it
much easier for modders to change the appearance of items in your inventory,
unlocking more possibilities.

Buttons in the user interface can now be styled differently when they are
focused, making it possible to give context to users who are not using a mouse.

Miscellaneous improvements include that markdown is now properly used for the
Lua API documentation, Desour implemented crafting performance improvements, and
some audio bugs were fixed.


## Games News

### MineClone2

{% include youtube.html id="F-Lai53_Ry4" caption="Mineclone Trailer - the 'Safe and Sound' update" %}

[MineClone2](https://content.luanti.org/packages/Wuzzy/mineclone2/) v0.83,
the "Safe and Sound" update, was released. The new version brings many
quality-of-life features to players and server owners. Elytras used to move
faster than the map generator could keep up with, so the maximum speeds on
Elytra have been adjusted, and are now accessible in settings. New background
music was added and some nodes now have new footstep sounds. The sunset
visualization has been improved, and individual biomes have tinted water and
greenery. Mobs can ride minecarts now, and bamboo can be broken by pistons.

There are tons more improvements across the board; see the full changelog
[here](https://forum.luanti.org/viewtopic.php?p=423766#p423766).

### Exile

{% include figure_gallery.html items=page.exilewaffle %}

[Exile](https://content.luanti.org/packages/Mantar/exile/) by
[Mantar](https://content.luanti.org/users/Mantar/) was updated to fix holes
appearing in Exile's landscape (aka waffling). This only fixes new areas by
default, but the update also includes a command to fix already-generated terrain.

### X Farming

{% include figure.html src="/static/blog/2023_April/xfarmingrice.png"
    caption="The New Natural Rice Fields" %}

[X Farming](https://content.luanti.org/packages/SaKeL/x_farming/) by
[Sakel](https://content.luanti.org/users/SaKeL/) saw a massive update to make
farming more enjoyable.

The new additions include:

- Bees for apiculture, along with honey and other nodes. Bee "mobs" are
  nodes, so they are performant.

{% include youtube.html id="rrV4OJ3-IWQ" caption="The bees" %}

- Interactive candles which can be coloured with dyes. There are 4 possible
  candle nodes, which can be obtained by placing more candles in the same spot.

- A BBQ stove on which to place up to 6 (cookable) items. It acts like a furnace but
  does not require fuel.

- Rice farming

{% include youtube.html id="x3cS5REtyjw" caption="Rice, Candles and the new stove (at about 3:00)" %}

- Shareable food which can be placed in the world allowing anyone wielding a
  bowl to take a portion of that food.

{% include youtube.html id="hpEI5yiTHQE" caption="Let the feasts begin!" %}

Miscellaneous additions include ropes and pillows.

Finally, X Farming no longer has mandatory dependencies. It works with Mineclone
out of the box and can be easily adapted to any other game.

### Automobiles Pack

{% include figure.html src="/static/blog/2023_April/transam.jpg"
    caption="Styled Ride" %}

A new car, the 1977 Trans Am, was added to [Automobiles Pack](https://content.luanti.org/packages/apercy/automobiles_pck/) by [Apercy](https://content.luanti.org/users/apercy/). The
vehicle introduces a 2-speed automatic transmission with visual cues for the
player.


### Easter Eggs

[Ineva](https://content.luanti.org/users/Ineva/), Sven, Glubux and Apercy have shared the [Easter Egg mod](https://content.luanti.org/packages/Ineva/ostereier/) from the [Yourland Server](https://your-land.de/).
Search the wilds for naturally-spawning easter eggs, and enjoy yummy
chocolate!

## Education

### Minetest at Journée du Libre Éducatif

{% include figure.html src="/static/blog/2023_April/france_workshop.jpg"
    caption="Minetest at JdLE 2023" %}

Thomate and Lemente, who use Minetest to host various workshops, as well as
Riwad Salim and Vincent Puig from the IRI Foundation who work on the [UNEJ
project](https://tac93.fr/capacitation/unej), were invited to present how to "develop an educative and contributive
digital common with the Minetest platform" at the French "Journée du Libre
Éducatif", an event dedicated to FOSS in education (find the full event program
[here](https://journee-du-libre-educatif.forge.aeif.fr/programme/#apres-midi)). The main goal was to present the possibilities of Minetest and the
benefits of Free Software in Education, with projects such as [Minestory](http://minetest.wp.ac-dijon.fr/minestory-frise-immersive-de-sites-du-patrimoine-architectural/),
[Minetest Classroom](https://eml.ubc.ca/projects/gamifying-forestry/), and [Blockalot](https://www.blockalot.de/), to a handful of teachers and educators
from across France. Guests were also able to meet and discuss how
to better cooperate and contribute to the Minetest edu ecosystem.

For more info, you can get in touch with them and other educators on
[Discord](https://discord.gg/hUs9xT634S) and [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/7067035/).

### Minetest Poster and Minetest presentation in Italy

{% include figure.html src="/static/blog/2023_April/poster.png"
    caption="Minetest Poster by Zughy" %}

Zughy made a poster to promote Minetest as he presents Minetest at various
conventions this summer. It is under a creative commons license, so anyone is
free to print it out and post it on local posterboards. So far, there is an
Italian and an English translation. You can find the files [here](https://gitlab.com/marco_a/minetest-flyer-poster).

### Minetest-related website shadow banned by Bing (and DuckDuckGo)

The website of one of our code developers was banned by Bing and DuckDuckGo last
year for an unknown reason. The website hosts the
[Minetest Modding Book](https://rubenwardy.com/minetest_modding_book/) along
with some other Minetest-related resources. If you'd like to know more or think
you might be able to help,
[rubenwardy wrote a blog post last month about the situation](https://blog.rubenwardy.com/2023/04/26/bing-ban/).

### Play Store Availability

While it happened in May rather than April, we would like to note that Minetest (5.7)
is once again available on the Android Play Store.
