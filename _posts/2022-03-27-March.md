This month, there is big news regarding engine-related side projects. Shadows
receive an update, and a couple games get major new features. Last but not
least, the blog is becoming official!

## Engine News

[Jordach](https://content.luanti.org/users/Jordach/) is making a more
realistic C++ mapgen. Imagine deep, wide oceans spanning the map; getting lost
at sea is a real danger. Small islands dot the expanse. Oceanic trenches yawn in
the depths below. Long beaches snake the coastline. On the continents, crags
kilometers high scrape the clouds, and the wide, low-lying plains are lightly
crinkled by rolling hills, providing excellent building area.

In order to accomplish this, Jordach made a model of the entire map in blender,
using the sampled noise sources encoded into images. He was then able to mix the
noise sources in blender, designing them to produce the large-scale landscape in
real-time. The mixing code was translated from blender to lua, and from lua to
C++.

The [mapgen](https://github.com/Jordach/minetest/tree/mg_reverb) is WIP, and
will continue development until its ready for an engine PR.

Another area that we can agree needs improvement is Minetest's main menu.
[Zughy](https://content.luanti.org/users/Zughy/) and
[Giova](https://content.luanti.org/users/giov4/) are working on a detailed
design for the menu. While they are not actually implementing it (just doing the
planning and asset work); there are rumors that someone else is working on
actual implementation. Stay tuned, this could go somewhere nice.

Paradust is trying to port minetest to run in a browser. The demo is playable
(YMMV), though there are many bugs. Try seed 2222.
[Try it online here](https://minetest.dustlabs.io/).

Minetest 5.6 development is underway. After the team re-enabled dynamic shadows,
[x2048](https://content.luanti.org/users/x2048/) began improving them. Shadows
are now [rendered on entities](https://github.com/minetest/minetest/pull/11747),
and and [api has been added](https://github.com/minetest/minetest/pull/11944) to
allow games to control shadow intensity.


## Game News

Earlier this month, [AiTechEye](https://content.luanti.org/users/AiTechEye/)
added added a new realm to
[XAenvironment](https://content.luanti.org/packages/AiTechEye/xaenvironment/).
It contains macroscopic fauna and flora. You can use the game's unique parkour
system to explore among the towering grass and mushrooms, while avoiding being
eaten by giant bugs.

In [Talas'](https://content.luanti.org/users/talas/)
[ColourHop](https://content.luanti.org/packages/talas/colourhop/), there's a
new end-game construction that allows for mass-production of complex structures.
It takes much study to figure out, and even more to master. There's no official
release yet, but its "coming soon".

Mantar is preparing for an Exile release which will add a dye system.


## Mod News

[Apercy](https://content.luanti.org/users/apercy/) has made an official
release of his
[Ju52 airplane](https://content.luanti.org/packages/apercy/ju52/) mod.
Also, many of his vehicles now have inventories.

[Elceejo](https://content.luanti.org/users/ElCeejo/) is experimenting with new
ways to use his
[Creatura API](https://content.luanti.org/packages/ElCeejo/creatura/). The latest
product is Spiradilus, a new Boss. It is heavily based on
[SCP-682](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-682). A public release is planned for
early April.

[wsor](https://content.luanti.org/users/wsor4035/) has been quietly working on
mods in the [mt-mods](https://github.com/mt-mods) repo, making them
game-agnostic. A few recently updated mods are: unified_dyes, basic_materials,
steel, and pipeworks. That means that other mods that only depend on those can
now be game agnostic as well.

[BuckarooBanzai](https://content.luanti.org/users/BuckarooBanzay/) has
developed a mod and server software called
[BlockExchange](https://content.luanti.org/packages/BuckarooBanzay/blockexchange/).
It allows you to share and use your builds (schematics) across different worlds.
(think: Thingiverse(tm) for Minetest builds) You can browse available builds
[here](https://blockexchange.minetest.land/), and with the mod installed on
singleplayer or on a server, you can download and place builds, or upload new
builds.

## In Other News

The Minetest blog is going to be made official! Plans are being worked on to
move the blog repository to the Minetest github account and possibly embed the
latest posts on the Minetest Website. Stay tuned for changes.
