## Engine News

### New Core Developer

The community welcomes longtime community member Lars MÃ¼ller (aka Luatic, appguru(eu), LMD) ([Github](https://github.com/appgurueu),
[ContentDB](https://content.luanti.org/users/LMD/)), as the newest Core Developer! He has made
[many contributions](https://github.com/minetest/minetest/commits?author=appgurueu) to documentation and entities, is
currently assisting the effort to [introduce the modern glTF model format](https://github.com/minetest/minetest/pull/14234),
and is working on [a PR to allow specific entities to be hidden from players](https://github.com/minetest/minetest/pull/13987).

### Improved Touchscreen Support

With SDL2 recently being set as the [default rendering backend](https://github.com/minetest/irrlicht/pull/209),
progress on better integration of gamepads and touchscreens can easily move forward.
[Grorp's PR](https://github.com/minetest/minetest/pull/14146) to enable mouse and touchscreen input on any device paired
with [work by okias](https://github.com/minetest/minetest/pull/14075) to switch between the two while playing marks
another great step towards universal input support.

### Entity Animation Improvements

Lars M. has [extended the capabilities of armature bones](https://github.com/minetest/minetest/pull/12388), allowing
mods to set individual bone position, rotation, and scale, with optional relation to defined animations and
interpolation over time. This will finally allow game developers and modders to implement smoother entity animations in Lua.

### God Rays Shader

x2048's [god rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crepuscular_rays) shader was
[adopted by lhofhansl](https://github.com/minetest/minetest/pull/13881) and merged into the development version of
Minetest 5.9.0. Similar to dynamic shadows, game developers can choose to enable
[the new lighting API features](https://github.com/minetest/minetest/blob/40bf88ac7483084c3ba9b77004c36c6f62ed05ca/doc/lua_api.md?plain=1#L8086)
to allow god rays in their games. Players must enable both bloom and volumetric lighting in their settings to utilize
the new shader.

### Touchscreen Tap Inputs

Many items are used by holding the place button (right mouse by default), such as
bows and shields from MineClone2. Until [PR #14087 by grorp](https://github.com/minetest/minetest/pull/14087), these
items did not work on touchscreens. With the PR merged, game and mod developers can determine which action a given item
performs on a long or short tap. The PR also changes the default touchscreen punch behavior to a short tap, improving
the Minetest combat experience and bringing it closer to other mobile voxel games.


## 2023 Game Jam Winners

[The 2023 Game Jam](https://forum.luanti.org/viewtopic.php?t=29957) was held in December with the theme "Unexpected".
Contestants were given three weeks to make games from scratch and submit them to ContentDB. After the community ranked
their favorite submissions on the new [Game Jam Site](https://jam.minetest.net), the winners emerged.

### 1st Place: Citadel by Irevol

{% include figure.html src="/static/blog/2024_January/Citadel.png" caption='The ruins of the citadel' %}

Weave through the past and future in the 4-dimensional parkour puzzle game
[Citadel](https://content.luanti.org/packages/_Irevol_/citadel/) by [Irevol](https://content.luanti.org/users/_Irevol_/).
You are a daring explorer searching the ruins of an ancient citadel. You find mysterious runes which allow you to
navigate space and time and unearth the secrets and treasures of the citadel.

### 2nd Place: The Velvet Crystal by Regulus

{% include figure.html src="/static/blog/2024_January/velvet_crystal.png" caption='The mission begins' %}

Recover the lost crystal and bring light back to the world in [The Velvet
Crystal](https://content.luanti.org/packages/regulus/regulus_mtgamejam_2023/) by [Regulus](https://content.luanti.org/users/regulus/),
a parkour game with a twist. Use your wand to perform stunts and help you navigate the castle. Gather information from
voiced NPCs and defeat the final boss to recover the velvet crystal.

### 3rd place: The Unexpected Gambit by NO11

{% include figure.html src="/static/blog/2024_January/gambit.png" caption='Your move' %}

Are you a chess lover? [The Unexpected Gambit](https://content.luanti.org/packages/NO11/the_unexpected_gambit/) by [NO11](https://content.luanti.org/users/NO11/) will keep you on your toes with crazy moves that come at unexpected moments. Experience a very polished implementation of
a classic game with interesting twists in The Unexpected Gambit.

### Honorable Mentions

Thank you to everyone who participated in the game jam and congratulations to the winners! We hope all the participants
continue to improve their games to become polished player experiences and great showcases of what Minetest can do.
Here are some other interesting projects that emerged from the 2023 jam.

#### MineOS

{% include figure.html src="/static/blog/2024_January/mineos.png" caption='It can even run Boom!' %}

[MineOS](https://content.luanti.org/packages/jordan4ibanez/mineos/) by [jordan4ibanez](https://content.luanti.org/users/jordan4ibanez/)
is an astonishing demo, especially for those familiar with Minetest's GUI capabilities. MineOS implements a polished
graphical operating system with retro sound effects and animations and includes several windowed apps to play with,
including a 3D [DOOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(franchise))-like shooter. It was certainly unexpected.

#### Shadow Forest

{% include figure.html src="/static/blog/2024_January/shadowForest.png" caption='The Shadows are coming!' %}

[Shadow Forest](https://content.luanti.org/packages/Wuzzy/shadow_forest/) by [Wuzzy](https://content.luanti.org/users/Wuzzy/)
is a polished role-playing game where you fill the shoes of the Wizard of Light (and his trusty Light Crystal companion).
Your quest is to rid the forest of the invading Shadows. Collect resources, level up your skills, and use your Staff of
Light to defeat the Shadows. Read more about [the making of Shadow Forest on Wuzzy's website!](https://wuzzy.codeberg.page/games/makingof_shadow_forest/)

[World War I airplane combat mod](https://content.luanti.org/packages/apercy/ww1_planes/).

### TypeScript For Minetest

[jordan4ibanez](https://content.luanti.org/users/jordan4ibanez/) has created custom
[TypeScript type definitions for Minetest](https://github.com/jordan4ibanez/forgotten-lands/blob/23def382ab8acd30e8bdd840705439dda1d894fc/minetest-api.d.ts)
to use with [the TypeScriptToLua transpiler](https://typescripttolua.github.io/). He is developing and using it with his project
[ForgottenLands](https://github.com/jordan4ibanez/forgotten-lands), written almost entirely in TypeScript.

### BlockExchange

{% include figure_gallery.html items=page.gallery_BlEx %}

The [Blockexchange project](https://content.luanti.org/packages/BuckarooBanzay/blockexchange/) by [BuckarooBanzay](https://content.luanti.org/users/BuckarooBanzay/) has undergone a few rewrites and enhancements to improve the overall user experience. Blockexchange now
supports logging in with ContentDB, features schematics on the homepage, supports [CDB Collections](https://content.luanti.org/collections/)
and markdown on detail pages, and sports a new, faster interface. Check out the new features at <https://blockexchange.minetest.ch>.

## Other News

### Minetest at Events in Italy

In late 2023 Minetest was featured at several conventions around Italy thanks to [Zughy](https://content.luanti.org/users/Zughy)
and his sponsor Italian Linux Society. Zughy demonstrated Minetest and gave talks at several events, from underground
videogame festivals like _Zona Warpa_ to free software events like [_MERGE-it_](https://merge-it.net/) (you can watch
one of the talks in Italian [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBZoPYleoX4)). In December,
Zughy also presented a workshop in Empoli, Italy where participants learned how to create minigames from scratch using
[arena_lib](https://content.luanti.org/packages/Zughy/arena_lib/). It doesn't look like these events are going to stop
any time soon, so what's next? FOSDEM!

## FOSDEM 2024

Minetest will be among [several stands](https://fosdem.org/2024/news/2023-11-20-accepted-stands-fosdem-2024/) at
[FOSDEM 2024](https://fosdem.org/2024/)! FOSDEM is the largest free and open-source software conference in Europe and
will be held on February 3rd and 4th in Brussels, Belgium. The Minetest booth will be showing off the engine and
community content, giving out stickers and goodies, and introducing visitors to the platform!

If you happen to be in the area, come say hi!
